This directory contains assorted diagrams, most of which are generated via [`mermaid.js`], with source files in [`src`] and images in [`images`].

## General

- [`mermaid.js`] diagrams are generated declaratively, and may present occasional rendering artifacts.
- Most [`mermaid.js`] tutorials online present an `%%{init:}` directive on a single line, despite excessive line length.
- `SVG` diagrams can be generated via [mermaid.live]

## Representative diagrams

- [matching.md] has a color theme matched to Econia's doc site schema.
- [matching-engine.md] (deprecated) has complexly-nested subgraphs and different classes.
