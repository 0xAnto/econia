Welcome to the developer documentation site for Econia, a hyper-parallelized on-chain order book for the Aptos blockchain

## What is Econia?

Econia is a protocol that lets anyone in the world trade a digital asset with anyone else in the world, at whatever price they want.
More specifically, Econia is an order book, a fundamental financial tool utilized by financial institutions like stock markets, except unlike the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, Econia is open-source and decentralized.

## Econia is in development

Econia is currently under development, and this is the second major iteration that has shipped to the [Aptos](https://aptos.dev) blockchain.

If you are a builder and you are interested in working with Econia, first take a look at the [design overview](https://econia.dev/design-overview), as this provides a technical breakdown that will provide some context for the system design.
Then try [using Econia](using.md), and let's see what we can build together!
