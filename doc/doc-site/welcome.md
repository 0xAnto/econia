Welcome to the developer documentation site for Econia, a hyper-parallelized on-chain order book for the Aptos blockchain

## What is Econia?

Econia is a protocol that lets anyone in the world trade a digital asset with anyone else in the world, at whatever price they want.
More specifically, Econia is an order book, a fundamental financial tool utilized by financial institutions like stock markets, except unlike the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, Econia is open-source and decentralized.

## Econia is in development

Econia is currently under development, and this is the second major iteration that has shipped to the [Aptos](https://aptos.dev) blockchain.

If you are a builder and you are interested in working with Econia, first take a look at the [design overview](https://econia.dev/design-overview), as this provides a technical breakdown that will provide some context for the system design.
Then try out the Econia [APIs](apis.md), and let's see what we can build together!

## Devnet account

As of 2022-08-25, Econia is initialized on the Aptos devnet at account [0xb1d4c0de8bc24468608637dfdbff975a0888f8935aa63338a44078eec5c7b6c7](https://aptos-explorer.netlify.app/account/0xb1d4c0de8bc24468608637dfdbff975a0888f8935aa63338a44078eec5c7b6c7).

Note that the Aptos devnet typically resets each Thursday, occasionally with breaking changes.
Pending the reconciliation of such breaking changes after devnet reset, Econia is typically republished as soon as the necessary patches are implemented.
The above listing is the most up-to-date listing for the official address, so if there is nothing published at it, then patches are likely underway for the most recent weekly reset's breaking changes.
