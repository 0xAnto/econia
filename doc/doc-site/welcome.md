Welcome to the developer documentation site for Econia, a hyper-parallelized on-chain order book for the Aptos blockchain.

If you haven't already, consider checking out Econia Labs' [Teach yourself Move on Aptos](https://github.com/econia-labs/teach-yourself-move) guide for some helpful background information!

## What is Econia?

Econia is a protocol that lets anyone in the world trade a digital asset with anyone else in the world, at whatever price they want.
More specifically, Econia is an order book, a fundamental financial tool utilized by financial institutions like stock markets, except unlike the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, Econia is decentralized, open-source, and permissionless.

## Econia is in development

Econia is currently under development, and this is the third major iteration that has shipped to the [Aptos](https://aptos.dev) blockchain.

If you are a builder and you are interested in working with Econia, start by taking a look at the [design overview](overview/index.md), as this provides a technical breakdown that will provide some context for the system design.
Then try out the Econia [APIs](api/index.md), and let's see what we can build together!

## Account listings

As of 2022-10-21, Econia is initialized on the Aptos devnet and testnet at the following accounts:

| Network | Account                                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Devnet  | [0xc0deb00c9154b6b64db01eeb77d08255300315e1fa35b687d384a703f6034fbd] |
| Testnet | [0xb1d4c0de8bc24468608637dfdbff975a0888f8935aa63338a44078eec5c7b6c7] |

Note that the Aptos devnet has historically reset each Thursday, occasionally with breaking changes.
Pending the reconciliation of such breaking changes after devnet reset, Econia is typically republished as soon as the necessary patches are implemented.
The above listings are the most up-to-date address listings, so if there is nothing published at them, then patches are likely underway for republication following a network reset.
