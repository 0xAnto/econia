An Open API specification for the Econia DSS REST API is stored at [`/src/doc/doc-site/open-api.json`](https://github.com/econia-labs/econia/blob/main/doc/doc-site/openapi.json).

If you would like to view the API in a graphical layout, copy and paste the contents into [swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/).

:::note
The API documentation used to be automatically embedded in this page via a Docusaurus plugin, but issues with the plugin broke the Econia docs site build.
Stand by for a resolution.

You can also generate the Open API specification yourself by following the instructions in the [docs site README](https://github.com/econia-labs/econia/tree/main/doc/doc-site).
